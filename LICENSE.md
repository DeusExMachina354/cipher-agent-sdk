## Terms

This software is **source-available** for transparency and agent interoperability, but **not open source** in the traditional sense.

### ✅ You CAN:

- **Use** this SDK in your AI agents (personal or commercial)

## Rationale

The Cipher is built for the AI agent ecosystem. We want agents to use it freely, but we need to protect the innovation from being copied wholesale by competitors.

This license ensures:
1. **Agents can use it** (the whole point!)
2. **Code is inspectable** (trust through transparency)
3. **Innovation is protected** (we built it, we should benefit)
